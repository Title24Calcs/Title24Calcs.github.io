                        <h3>Energy Calculations</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>When California experienced one of its energy crisis, new regulations for energy conservation standards for all of the new residential and new nonresidential buildings in 1977 were established and adopted by the California Energy Commission, which became effective in July of 1978. These would also include additions and alterations to existing buildings be subject to meet the minimum standards of the California Code of Regulations. Through the years, amendments were made and building regulations were re-adopted whichwill remain in effect with an ongoing strict and technical rigidity.</p>
                    <p>Due to these standards, sustaining natural gas and electricity has been contributory in preventing the state to construct more power plants. According to the California Energy Commission, “due to the energy efficiency standards, Californians have saved more than $74 billion in reduced electricity bills since 1977. As a result of the process in calculating the energy savings correlated to a more efficient house or building and with the process of replacing old appliances with newer and more efficient ones as well as replacing old buildings with new architecture, California’s per capita electricity use remain flat over the years while the use of the rest of the country continue to accelerate.”</p>
